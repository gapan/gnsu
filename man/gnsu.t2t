= NAME =

gnsu - Gnsu's Not SU


= SYNOPSIS =

**gnsu** //COMMAND// [//COMMANDOPTIONS//]


= DESCRIPTION =

**gnsu** allows a permitted user to execute a //command// with superuser priviliges. **gnsu** shows a graphical dialog requesting the user password to allow the execution of the specified command.

As **gnsu** uses **sudo** as its backend, the password that you need to provide is your user's password, //not// the //root// user password.

The user, or a group the user is part of, has to be allowed access to launching applications using sudo. This can be accomplished by editing the **/etc/sudoers** file using the **visudo** command.


= GENERAL OPTIONS =

: **-h**, **--help**
Prints a usage message briefly summarizing all command-line options
and exits.
